# Mobile-Communication-and-Computing

This is the repository where I have developed Java ME Applications using NetBeans IDE, implemented Mobile security basic algorithms and explored NS2 Simulation tool.<br>

**List of experiments:**<br>
1. WAP for simple calculator in J2ME<br>
2. WAP to check whether a given number is prime in J2ME.<br>
3. WAP a program to check whether a given string is a palindrome in J2ME.<br>
4. WAP a program to reverse a given string without using the standard functions in J2ME.<br>
5. WAP a program to calculate the Simple and Compound Interest in J2ME.<br>
6. WAP a program to calculate the area and circumference of a circle in J2ME.<br>
7. WAP a program to calculate the area and perimeter of a rectangle and square in J2ME.<br>
8. WAP to find the FACTORIAL of a given number using recursion in J2ME<br>
9. WAP to find largest among three numbers in J2ME.<br>
10. WAP to check if the given number is Armstrong number or not in J2ME.<br>
11. WAP to Display Armstrong numbers between 1 to 1000 in J2ME.<br>
12. WAP to check if a given number is a palindrome in J2ME<br>
13. WAP to generate Fibonacci series till a given number in J2ME<br>
14. WAP to accept number of days from the user and Convert it into years, months and days in J2ME<br>
